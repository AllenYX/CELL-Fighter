# CELL Fighter
This is a 2D cell simulator/shoot 'em up game made in Unity. It started as a project for teaching basic middle/high school cellular biology, focusing on the types and functions of organelles. Due to time constraints, only a "test" version was able to be completed(also means rather bad code). I hope to update/complete this eventually, but its currently not a high priority. This was made using version 4.3.4 of the Unity editor.

The most recent build of the game only supports Windows on 16:9 resolutions. Other resolutions will be subject to stretching. Only the "CELL Fighter_Data" file and "CELL Fighter.exe" are required for playing the game.
